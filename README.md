## Web Scraper
Web scraper designed to pair with my homework planner website that pulls data off the planner and can manipulate it in several ways.
The website used for this project was created with Bradon Soucy and the link is https://bksoucy.w3.uvm.edu/cs008/final/display.php
The scraper allows you to either print out the site data into python or write the data to a file.

- Must have requests package installed to use!!!!
